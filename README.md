# BackSpace

BackSpace is an android application created with the purpose of providing students of LUMS with a platform that would allow them to connect with their respective Luminites. Although a similar platform already exists (LUMS Discussion Forum) on Facebook, the existing platform has countless limitations including non-categorized data, tedious induction process, and hard to find data. The application will allow users to:

- Access information regarding courses and instructors
- Chat with their friends in groups
- Receive real-time notifications
- access to up-to-date information using subgroups
- And much more

View the prototype of the application on Figma using the following [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/cw6zDdVIwEIlNkG9Quuwe3/BackSpace?node-id=2%3A101&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A101).
